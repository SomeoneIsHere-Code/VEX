12/16/21

Tested and refined the Right auton, it now works

12/15/21

Changed YINT to YBOOL and hopefully fixed the toggle

Changed new golden angle to 140 degrees (was 143 degrees)

12/13/21

Tested new lower angle, didn't work, reverted it

tested the Y button toggle, didn't work, reverted it


12/10/21

Tested the new lift depth, 480 is a bit too far, keeping it there for competitions as going a little too low is not a bad thing. For future auton
refrence, new auton low is 470 degrees

rerewrote the right simple auton

rerewrote the left simple auton

began formalizing and routing a left win point

12/08/21

12/07/21

rerouted autonomous, now going for neutral goal first

began rewriting R auton

deleted all other autons


12/06/21 

Changed the onne time y button to a toggle

Removed limit break buttons as they are a relic of the previous claw design

Added a list of unused buttons at the top of robot-config.cpp

Changed some of the 'lower lift 460 degrees' to 'lower lift 480 degrees' to hopefully aid in consistency

Temporarily decreased drive speed on win point auton for testing consistency

Removed and simplified unused brain text display code

Considered changing our name to "Ecstacy Red"
