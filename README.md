Welcome to the code of one extraordinarily scatterbrained individual who has way too much time on his hands. This is the Github Repo of Miles Bourgeois from team <b> 8756A </b>


1/16/22 THE AUTON UPDATE

All of the auton work (and some of the controlls work) from the past ~2 months totaling 50ish hours of coding. If Ava or Carson are reading this, I'm doing this bc I'm actively making massive structural changes, if anyone else is reading this, I'm doing this bc I want to get roasted for somehow managing to make good code without good talent. Enjoy!!!


1/23/22 THE FUTURE UPDATE

This is a small update that will begin logging my descent into madness. What's causing me to go mad you may ask, well I'm going to begin work on a script that autowrites odometry code for your bot. No clue how this is going to work (or how long it's going to take) but in theory it should be as simple as writing a python script that does all of the stuff (can you tell that I barely know what odometry is), then converts the instructions from python code into a .txt with all of your vexCode commands that you should be able to copy and paste into your preffered ide. I will begin work once I'm done with another project that I'm working on, but I will hopefully post weekly updates along with releasing the full code once I'm done. I will be using a document written by team 5225 and seeing as how they were kind enough to share the introductory concepts, I will be releasing all of my code for free, as well as any odometry that we do end up building into our auton.
