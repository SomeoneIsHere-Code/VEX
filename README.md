Welcome to the code of one extraordinarily scatterbrained individual who has way too much time on his hands. This is the Github Repo of Miles Bourgeois from team <b> 8756A </b>


1/16/22 THE AUTON UPDATE

All of the auton work (and some of the controlls work) from the past ~2 months totaling 50ish hours of coding. If Ava or Carson are reading this, I'm doing this bc I'm actively making massive structural changes, if anyone else is reading this, I'm doing this bc I want to get roasted for somehow managing to make good code without good talent. Enjoy!!!
